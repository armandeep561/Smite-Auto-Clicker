*(Note: You should replace the placeholder above with an actual screenshot of your application)*

A powerful, feature-rich autoclicker built with Python and PyQt6. This application goes beyond simple clicking, offering advanced targeting controls, multiple activation modes, and a sleek, modern user interface inspired by Fluent Design.

It is designed to be both highly functional for complex automation tasks and intuitive for everyday use.

## Core Features

This autoclicker is packed with features that provide precision, control, and convenience for a wide range of applications, from gaming to data entry.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Clicking Engine
- **Adjustable Click Speed:** Set a precise number of clicks per second (CPS) using a responsive slider.
- **Dynamic CPS Modes:** Choose from pre-configured speed tiers to quickly change performance:
    - **Normal (1-30 CPS):** Safe for most applications.
    - **Fast (31-50 CPS):** High speed that may be suspicious in some contexts.
    - **Extreme (51-80 CPS):** Highly detectable speed for high-risk use.
    - **Insane (81-100 CPS):** Maximum output for experimental purposes, virtually guaranteed to be detected.
- **Mouse Button Selection:** Choose between **Left**, **Right**, or **Middle** mouse buttons.
- **Click Type Emulation:** Emulate **Single** or **Double** clicks.
- **Click Randomization:** Introduce slight, random delays between clicks to mimic human behavior, making automation less detectable.

### üéØ Advanced Targeting System
- **Current Mouse Position:** The default mode, clicking at the current location of your mouse cursor.
- **Specific Coordinates:** Set a fixed X/Y coordinate on the screen for all clicks.
    - Includes a **Pixel-Perfect Location Picker**, an overlay tool with a crosshair and magnifier to precisely select screen coordinates.
- **Specific Window Targeting:** A powerful filter that restricts all clicking actions to a chosen application window. The autoclicker will automatically pause if the mouse moves outside the window and resume only when it re-enters, ensuring other applications are not accidentally clicked.

### ‚ö° Activation & Control
- **Fully Customizable Hotkeys:** Set your own unique keys to start and stop the autoclicker.
- **Dual Activation Modes:**
    - **Toggle Mode:** The classic mode. Press the start hotkey to begin clicking and the stop hotkey to end.
    - **Hold Mode:** A more direct control method. Clicking is only active *while the activation hotkey is being held down* and stops instantly upon release.

### üíæ Automation & Persistence
- **Click Limiter:** Configure the autoclicker to stop automatically after a specific number of clicks has been reached. Ideal for tasks that require a finite number of actions.
- **Profile System:** Save complex configurations (CPS, targeting, hotkeys, etc.) as named profiles. Load any profile with a single click to instantly switch between setups for different tasks.
- **Session Logs:** View a history of past autoclicking sessions, including start/end times and total clicks.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Framework:** PyQt6 for the graphical user interface.
- **Core Libraries:**
    - `pynput`: For listening to and controlling mouse and keyboard events.
    - `pygetwindow`: For finding and managing application windows for the targeting feature.

## Installation & Usage

To run this application, you will need Python 3 and a few external libraries.

#### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

#### 2. Setup
1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
